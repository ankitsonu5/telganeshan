                             <p class="text-justify">Most of us strive to achieve the best in every way possible. But not all of us succeed in every endeavor. As a result, there is an unaccountable amount of passion left discouraged. The reasons might be diverse. However, what stops most of us from picking up those unfulfilled dreams and nurturing them into something big?</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">Philanthropy is not only a way to aid the unfortunate in their lives but also fulfilling your own purpose in life by contributing your part to the global community. Once you step into the world of helping others, you realize that the world is becoming a better place step by step, and you are a reason for that.</p>

Now, he wanted to accomplish for the world, the world that helped me to be what he is today. He worked hard to make a place in the global community, a respectable place where he could be happy. But one seldom stays happy when the sorrowful world catches all your attention.</p>
